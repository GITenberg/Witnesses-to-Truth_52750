5</span>DIFFICULTIES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bible has been compared to a
river in which a child may wade, and an elephant swim; by which
is meant that it is full of practical truth so plainly revealed
that a little child may rejoice in it, while at the same time it
is full of truth so deep that the loftiest intellect of man is
very soon out of its depth in the study of it.&nbsp; Thus there
are few things more beautifully simple than a living faith.&nbsp;
It is the unquestioning trust of one who loves his God and
Saviour; the calm repose of the dependent heart on One who has
summed up His Gospel in the words &ldquo;Come unto
Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus there are thousands, and tens of thousands,
of happy believers who have accepted the great salvation just as
God has given it; and who, without perplexing their minds about
matters which they cannot understand, most thankfully receive
what God has revealed, and rejoice in it with their whole hearts
as belonging to themselves and their children.&nbsp; As little
children they receive and trust, the result of which is that they
rest <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>in
their Saviour as a child rests in its mother&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp;
I believe there are those by whom such persons are despised, and
by whom they are regarded as weak, foolish, and contemptible; but
they have the joy of the Lord, and, instead of being
<i>despised</i>, they may well be <i>envied</i> by those who, in
the consciousness of superior intellect, consider themselves
qualified to despise their folly.</p>
<p>But, while we rejoice in this simple and childlike Christian
faith, it is vain to deny that in &ldquo;the deep things of
God&rdquo; there are difficulties, and that there are other minds
to whom these difficulties are a source of real and grave
perplexity.&nbsp; I am not now speaking of those who delight in
magnifying difficulties, and whose only object in reading their
Bible is to find out something at which they may cavil; but I am
speaking rather of thoughtful men who respect religion, and are
not opposed to truth; who have never set their face against the
Gospel; and to whom it would be a real cause of heartfelt
thanksgiving if they were able to receive, in the simplicity of
faith, the great salvation revealed to them in the Word of
God.&nbsp; They have no wish to be unbelievers; their hearts are
not set against the truth; and they believe enough to make them
long to believe <i>the whole</i>.&nbsp; But there are some things
that perplex them, and there are certain difficulties which they
cannot quite get over.</p>
<p>Now, without the slightest hesitation or disguise, I fully and
frankly admit that there are very serious <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>difficulties in
the revelation of God, and difficulties which I believe it is not
in the power of the human intellect to solve.&nbsp; When,
therefore, a person says that he cannot understand all that is
revealed, I agree with him.&nbsp; If he add that on that account
he cannot believe, I altogether dissent from his conclusion; but
as to the existence of difficulties he is undoubtedly
right.&nbsp; We, who believe, know perfectly well, and fully
admit, that there are things in divine revelation which we are
altogether unable either to explain or understand.</p>
<p>Think, for example, of the divinity of our blessed Lord and
Saviour, and the perfect union of a divine and human nature in
His one sacred person.&nbsp; I am not afraid to state plainly my
firm conviction that no human intellect can explain it.&nbsp; If
He were only an appearance of God Himself that would be
intelligible; or if He were only man endued with very high
qualifications, that again would be within our reach; but that He
should be in His one person both perfect God and perfect man, or,
in other words, both infinite and finite, that I believe to be
far beyond the reach of <i>human</i> explanation.</p>
<p>It is the same with the doctrine of election, and its union
with human responsibility.&nbsp; The two appear to be opposed to
each other, but, notwithstanding that, they are both found in the
Gospel.&nbsp; How can it be explained?&nbsp; How can it be?&nbsp;
I cannot tell.&nbsp; Some people meet the difficulty by cutting
out one side, and some by cutting out the other; but neither one
process of excision <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>nor the other can satisfy a really thinking mind.&nbsp;
And the difficulty remains, for we find both sides in
Scripture.</p>
<p>Who, again, can explain a resurrection?&nbsp; We see in spring
that wonderful revival of life which is a type of it.&nbsp; But
who can explain the thing itself?&nbsp; What physician, or what
scientific philosopher, can explain how the dead shall be made
alive?&nbsp; Whenever it is done it must be done by some power of
which man knows nothing, so that the resurrection of the dead is
something which, <i>to the knowledge of man</i>, appears
impossible.</p>
<p>Then again, in conclusion, look around on all the sin and
misery of the world.&nbsp; We know that it is explained in the
Scriptural account of the fall, and that there is a remedy
provided in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; But there is something
inexpressibly appalling in the facts.&nbsp; Here is this
beautiful world, that appears to have been created as a happy
home for holy inhabitants, filled with sin, misery, ruin, pain,
anguish, remorse, strife, sickness, and ultimately death.&nbsp;
And when we think of the words, &ldquo;In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth,&rdquo; and when we contrast the
Creator with the present condition of creation, there is enough
to fill the heart with amazement, and to make the thoughtful man
exclaim, &ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now with this full and frank acknowledgment of difficulty we
are brought face to face with the question, <i>What effect should
these difficulties have on our faith</i>?&nbsp; Should they shake
it, or should they confirm it?&nbsp; <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Should they lead us to give up the
Gospel, or should they establish our trust, and induce us to
cleave to it more stedfastly than ever?&nbsp; Some people will
say, &ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; and will tell you, because there
are difficulties to settle, to settle down in sceptical
distrust!&nbsp; But surely they are not wise in giving such
advice, nor in acting on such principles.&nbsp; They certainly do
not act so in common life, and such conduct is not in harmony
with the wisdom of the world.</p>
<p>Can you explain how a little thin vapour rising up from
boiling water can force a long line of heavy-laden carriages
through the country at the rate of fifty miles an hour?&nbsp; But
you rely on the arrangements of those who can, and, trusting
them, you do not refuse to take your seat in the train.</p>
<p>Can you explain all the deep currents of the ocean, or how it
is that water became endowed with such properties as to bear up a
great, heavy, iron ship?&nbsp; But you trust those who have
constructed the vessel, and, without attempting to understand the
construction, you do not hesitate to go to sea.</p>
<p>Can you explain the chemical properties of medicine, or how it
is that it will act on your system and do you good?&nbsp; But you
trust a physician, and you take it.</p>
<p>Can you explain how it is that the will, that secret, hidden,
indescribable power within you, makes your hand move in obedience
to your wish?&nbsp; But would you on that account think it wise
never to move your limbs?</p>
<p>The fact is that in practical life we are surrounded in <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>all
directions with things which we cannot explain, and problems
which we cannot solve.&nbsp; We cannot escape from such
difficulties; they meet us at every turn.&nbsp; But in daily life
we never think of them.&nbsp; Our practical conduct is not
affected by them.&nbsp; We see what we have to do, and we do
it.&nbsp; We take our place in the train, we go on board the
ship, we send our telegram, we eat our food, and we move our
limbs, without ever endeavouring to solve the mysteries which
underlie all that we are doing.&nbsp; Now all I ask is that men
should act on the same principle with reference to the
Gospel.&nbsp; There are, as I have said, difficulties, and if you
never act until they are solved, a weary time you will have to
wait.&nbsp; But there is also a plain, simple, clear word of
invitation; there is a great salvation prepared, presented, and
proclaimed.&nbsp; There is a way of life so clearly taught that
he may run that readeth it.&nbsp; So the wise course is to say,
&ldquo;Difficulty or no difficulty, I accept the
invitation,&rdquo; and to act practically just as you do with
your food or your medicine.&nbsp; Your physician gives you
medicine, and, though you cannot explain how it will act, you
take it in trust.&nbsp; So your God gives you His salvation, and
your part is to accept His gift, and leave it to Him to solve the
deep mysteries of His hidden will.</p>
<p>But I cannot leave the subject there, for I am prepared to
maintain that these difficulties should confirm the faith, and to
claim them even as &ldquo;witnesses to truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; They are <i>witnesses to the truth of the
Scriptures</i>, <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>for in them we are told that we are sure to meet with
them.</p>
<p>While, as I have already said, the way of life is presented so
clearly that he may run that readeth it, there is at the same
time the perfectly clear statement that we must expect to find
difficulties in the revelation of God.&nbsp; Only look at St.
Peter&rsquo;s description of St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles in 2 Peter
iii. 16.&nbsp; In that passage he associates those Epistles with
the other Scriptures, and plainly declares that they contain some
things &ldquo;hard to be understood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Are we then to
be surprised if, in reading them, we meet with things &ldquo;hard
to be understood,&rdquo; or if we meet with men who venture to
cavil at them, and so wrest them to their own destruction?&nbsp;
I am prepared to maintain that if in St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles,
and the other Scriptures, there had been nothing &ldquo;hard to
be understood,&rdquo; then St. Peter himself would not have
spoken truth.&nbsp; The difficulties in the writings of St. Paul
are necessary to the complete truth of the Epistle of St.
Peter.</p>
<p>So St. Paul himself plainly teaches us that our knowledge in
this world is only partial.&nbsp; Only refer to his language in 1
Cor. xiii. 12.&nbsp; There are two facts there
stated&mdash;first, that our vision is indistinct, and then that
it is limited.&nbsp; It is indistinct, for we see through a glass
darkly, or through a dull refractor; and it is limited, for we
know only in part.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now we see through a glass,
darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall
I know even as also I am known.&rdquo;&nbsp; Are we to <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>be surprised
then if we do not enjoy a full, clear, sun-light vision of the
whole?&nbsp; And is not the indistinctness of our vision a proof
of the truth of the Scriptures?</p>
<p>So we meet in the Scriptures with the full recognition of the
selfsame difficulties that arise in modern times.&nbsp; These
difficulties are no new discoveries of the sharpened intellect of
the nineteenth century, but are as old as the Gospel itself.</p>
<p>Do you find a difficulty in explaining the perfect union of a
perfect Godhead and a perfect manhood in the one person of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ?&nbsp; I acknowledge frankly,
&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am not afraid to acknowledge that
I cannot explain it, and that I believe no one can.&nbsp; But my
point is that the Scriptures have prepared us for it, and that it
is the very difficulty which our Lord Himself presented to the
Pharisees when He said, &ldquo;If David then call him Lord, how
is he his son?&rdquo; (Matt xxii. 45.)</p>
<p>Do you find a difficulty in the doctrine of
&ldquo;election,&rdquo; and are you unable to reconcile the gift
of life to a chosen number with the perfect equity of the
universal government of God?&nbsp; If so, remember that there is
nothing new in such a difficulty.&nbsp; It is as old as the
Gospel itself, and it is fully recognized in the
Scriptures.&nbsp; Nothing can be more perfectly clear than the
statement made respecting it in Romans ix. 1&ndash;13, or than
the full recognition of the difficulty in verse
14&mdash;&ldquo;What shall we say then?&nbsp; Is there
unrighteousness with God?&nbsp; God forbid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>So,
once more, with the resurrection.&nbsp; Does it appear impossible
that the dead should rise again?&nbsp; Are you unable to conceive
the possibility of a body, lost in the ocean, burnt in the
flames, or corrupted in the grave, being restored to unity, life,
and vigour?&nbsp; I grant you that it does <i>seem</i>
impossible.&nbsp; I see the difficulty as much as any of
you.&nbsp; But let no man suppose that this difficulty is new, or
the discovery of it the result of his own independent intellect;
for in the Scriptures of truth we are fully prepared for
it.&nbsp; We are not taken by surprise, for we were warned of it
1800 years ago in our Bibles; for there we read, in verse 35 of
the great resurrection chapter (1 Cor. xv.), &ldquo;But some man
will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they
come?&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly there may be, at this present time,
some whom I am addressing, actually fulfilling that prophecy, and
so living amongst us as unintentional &ldquo;witnesses to its
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, whether there are or not, my point is that the
difficulties themselves are &ldquo;witnesses to the truth of the
Word of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bible says, plainly and repeatedly,
that there are things &ldquo;hard to be understood,&rdquo; and,
therefore, if I were to meet with nothing of the kind, and if
everything contained in St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles and the other
Scriptures were perfectly plain, the only conclusion at which I
could arrive would be that those Scriptures had not given a true
description of the fact.&nbsp; Now, however, I find them in this
most important matter perfectly true.&nbsp; The objection of the
sceptic <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>only leads me to trust my Bible.&nbsp; If there were no
difficulties, then I should begin to be afraid that my Bible
could not be from God.&nbsp; But now the infidel himself is one
of the best &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; that I can put into the
witness-box, and the very argument which he brings against the
possibility of the fulfilment of the promises of God is an
evidence, as clear as the noonday sun, of the wisdom, the
foreknowledge, and the perfect acquaintance with the human
understanding, with which God inspired, 1800 years ago, (by His
Holy Spirit) the Scriptures of truth.&nbsp; It reminds me of the
words of the apostle&mdash;&ldquo;Let God be true, but every man
a liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this is not all; for not only are these difficulties
exactly what are revealed in the Scriptures, but they are also
exactly what, as thinking men, we ought to expect in a divine
revelation.</p>
<p>Let us think what we mean by a divine revelation.&nbsp; We
mean, the communication from an infinite God to fallen man, of
His own plan for the salvation of the sinner.&nbsp; Now what
would a reasonable person expect in such a communication?&nbsp;
He would expect Him to inform us of all that concerned our own
action, and to make plain to us the way of life in which it is
His will that we should walk; but he would not expect Him to
indulge our craving after full information respecting His own
hidden being, or the mode and power by which He would carry out
His promises.&nbsp; He would expect Him to make His promises
plain, but he would not expect Him to explain to us His divine
plan for their <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>fulfilment; he would expect Him to do exactly what He
has done in the case of the resurrection&mdash;promise it
faithfully, and so lead us to trust Himself, without giving any
explanation as to the mode or the instrumentality by which that
promise should be fulfilled.&nbsp; And this is exactly the
principle which He Himself has laid down in His own Word, as when
He said (Deut. xxix., 29), &ldquo;The secret things belong unto
God,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> they are hidden in the depths of His own
infinite mind; &ldquo;but those things which are revealed belong
unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the
words of this law;&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> all that He has revealed we
may freely make use of, and even our little children may learn in
it the blessed secret of a Father&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>But does it not follow that the moment we attempt to reach
into the secrets of God we are perfectly certain to meet with
difficulty?&nbsp; We get out of depth directly, and are like
people who cannot swim.&nbsp; For how can the human mind, for one
moment, expect to solve the mysteries of the deep things of
God?&nbsp; How can it aspire either to fathom its depths, or to
scale its heights?&nbsp; Think for one moment what man is, a
little creature on this little ball of earth, here for a few
years, and then passing away for ever.&nbsp; And think what He
is, &ldquo;the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose
name is Holy,&rdquo; the &ldquo;everlasting God, the Creator of
the ends of the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; And is it likely that man
should be able to put as it were into the balances the deep
mysteries of His eternal will?&nbsp; When Zophar thought of it he
said <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>(Job
xi. 7, 8), &ldquo;Canst thou by searching find out God? canst
thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?&nbsp; It is as high
as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou
know?&rdquo;&nbsp; When David thought of the knowledge of God, he
said (Psalm cxxxix. 6), &ldquo;Such knowledge is too wonderful
for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.&rdquo;&nbsp; When
St. Paul was meeting the objection of those who cavilled at the
righteousness of the government of God, he met them with the
words (Rom. ix. 20), &ldquo;Nay, but, O man, who art thou that
repliest against God?&nbsp; Shall the thing formed say to him
that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?&rdquo;&nbsp; And when
the Sadducees put a difficult puzzle on the subject of the
resurrection, our Lord Himself silenced them with the words,
&ldquo;Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of
God.&rdquo; (Matt. xxii 29.)&nbsp; And were they not all
right?&nbsp; Shall the finite sit in judgment on the infinite?
the created on the Creator? the man of to-day on the God of all
eternity?&nbsp; And are we to doubt His revelation because we
cannot fathom the depths of His wisdom nor the hidden mysteries
of His being?&nbsp; Nay, rather, are not those very depths
witnesses to the divinity of His revelation?&nbsp; If it were all
so shallow that any young man could wade in it without wetting
even his ancles, might we not then believe that it came from some
shallow mind no deeper than his own?&nbsp; If it contained no
mysteries, might we not begin to doubt whether it really came
from a mysterious God?&nbsp; So these difficulties of which we
hear so <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>much in modern times, these difficulties on which so
many of our young men are so perfectly ready to decide, and on
account of which they are even tempted to cast aside the
revelation of God&mdash;these very difficulties are to us who
believe, divine &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; to the divine authorship
of the whole.&nbsp; Had the Book been a man&rsquo;s book, drawn
up by man to commend itself to the mind of man, it never would
have had in it those high and holy mysteries by which we see the
intellect of man altogether baffled.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s mind would
have produced nothing which man&rsquo;s mind could not
comprehend.</p>
<p>We may rejoice, therefore, in &ldquo;the breadth, and length,
and depth, and height;&rdquo; and, instead of being dismayed or
disheartened because we cannot fathom the unfathomable depths of
the unfathomable counsels of our God, we would rather say with
St. Paul, &ldquo;Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath
been His counsellor?&rdquo; and cling, with more tenacity than
ever, to this sacred and holy Book, thus shown by its very
mystery to be superhuman and supernatural, nothing less than a
revelation from God.</p>
<h2><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>THE
RACES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> subject now is one of almost
unlimited extent, for we are to call as &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo;
the races of the world.&nbsp; We are to take the evidence of
Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and of all the nations,
tongues, peoples, and languages that are dispersed throughout
them; and we are to consider the evidence which they bear to the
inspiration of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>As some limit must be put to such an enquiry, I propose to
confine our thoughts to the study of one passage of Scripture;
viz., Gen. ix. 25&ndash;27, &ldquo;Cursed be Canaan; a servant of
servants shall he be unto his brethren.&nbsp; And he said,
Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his
servant.&nbsp; God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in
the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Some people appear to speak with great disrespect of the
Pentateuch.&nbsp; It is well, therefore, to take from it an
ancient prophecy, and to study first the historical truth, and
secondly the prophetical accuracy of these remarkable words.</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Historical
Truth</span>.</h3>
<p>It is not an uncommon thing in these days to set science in
opposition to the Scriptures, and to speak as if the one were
opposed to the other.&nbsp; As a general <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>rule, the
persons who do so are persons who have a very shallow
acquaintance with either, for the truly scientific man, and the
true student of the Scriptures, are both so conscious of their
own limited attainments in the face of the vast fields of
unlimited knowledge which are still unexplored, that they are
sure to feel humbly on the subject, and to be very shy of bold
assertions respecting matters that they do not understand.&nbsp;
But, instead of science being opposed to the Scriptures, we are
quite prepared to call in science as a witness to its truth; for
science is the study of the creation of God, and it would be
indeed strange if His own works were at variance with His
Word.&nbsp; So we will turn now, if God permit, to one of the
great results of modern scientific discovery, and see what
testimony it bears to the truth of the Pentateuch.</p>
<p>The particular branch to which I would refer is what is called
&ldquo;Ethnology,&rdquo; or the study of the nations of the
world.&nbsp; This is comparatively quite a modern science, for it
is only quite lately that the world has been thrown open to the
investigation of scientific men.&nbsp; The two means by which it
has been thrown open have been the steam-engine, and Christian
missions.&nbsp; The steam-engine has enabled investigators to
travel in all directions, and Christian missions have led to the
study of hundreds of languages that were previously unknown.</p>
<p>The history of one of these languages is worth
recording.&nbsp; When the late Mr. Darwin visited the islands of
Tierra del Fuego, in the celebrated voyage of the <i>Beagle</i>,
he considered the inhabitants to be below ordinary <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>manhood, and
to have no language.&nbsp; But a devoted missionary, settled
amongst them, has not only found that they have a language, but
he has learned it, reduced it to writing, and translated into it
the Gospel of St. Luke.&nbsp; It has been printed by the British
and Foreign Bible Society, and is now read amongst the
people.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin, being a truly scientific man, was so
deeply interested at the discovery of his own mistake, that for
the last few years of his life he subscribed &pound;5 a year to
the South American Missionary Society.</p>
<p>Thus the missionary movement has brought about a vast increase
of scientific knowledge respecting the languages of the world,
and scientific men have had before them a mass of fresh material
to which their predecessors had no access whatever.&nbsp; The
British and Foreign Bible Society has circulated the Scriptures
in no less than 250 languages, by far the greater number of which
had never before been reduced to writing.&nbsp; By this means
there has been an immense impetus given to the researches of
scientific men.&nbsp; The two points to which especial attention
has been directed have been the structure of language, and the
formation of the skull.&nbsp; On these two points men of science
have most carefully collected information from all quarters of
the globe&mdash;north, south, east, and west; and they have
endeavoured to group, or classify, the various scattered nations
of mankind.</p>
<p>And now I come to the most remarkable and assuring fact, that,
after patient, laborious, and most elaborate <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>scientific
comparison, they have come to the conclusion that all the nations
of the earth may be grouped into three great families, and have
probably descended from three original centres.&nbsp; They name
these three great divisions the Aryan, the Semitic, and the
Turanian.&nbsp; But we need not trouble ourselves about the
names.&nbsp; The classification itself is the matter of supreme
importance; for in this discovery of the nineteenth century we
find the full confirmation of the account, written by Moses more
than 3,000 years ago, of the three sons of Noah surviving the
flood more than 4,000 years ago.&nbsp; In that narrative we find
the account of mankind starting afresh under three heads, Shem,
Ham, and Japheth.&nbsp; Since that time there have elapsed more
than 4,000 years, and now, in this nineteenth century, after all
the changes that have taken place, we find a body of learned and
unprejudiced men, enabled by the discovery of steam to discover
amongst mankind, as we now exist, precisely the same threefold
division that is described in the Scriptures as having taken
place in the days of Noah.&nbsp; Now how are we to explain this
fact?&nbsp; What is the cause of this strange coincidence?&nbsp;
It is utterly impossible that the Mosaic record should have been
constructed in order to suit the scientific discoveries of our
own day.&nbsp; And those who honour science would be the last to
admit that men of science have constructed their system on the
lines of the Mosaic record.&nbsp; But, there is one word that is
a key to the whole, one word that is the connecting-link between
the fifteenth century <i>before</i> <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Christ, and the nineteenth century
<i>after</i> Him; between the statements of the Scripture and the
researches of science, and that one word settles all.&nbsp; That
one word is <i>Truth</i>, truth in science, and truth in
Scripture; truth in the Word, and truth in the works of God.</p>
<p>But we have not yet done with history, for the tenth chapter
of Genesis gives us some idea of the direction in which these
three great families spread themselves over the surface of the
globe.&nbsp; A moment&rsquo;s thought will be sufficient to show
that it must be next to impossible to trace these descriptions
now.&nbsp; Vast changes have taken place during the 4,000 years
that have elapsed.&nbsp; Cities have sprung up and disappeared;
whole nations have risen to power, and passed away; names have
changed; there have been migrations, invasions, captivities, and
dispersions; so that the different families have in many cases
been strangely intermingled.&nbsp; But still there is a certain
outline given in the Pentateuch, and a certain outline agreed
upon by the men of science.&nbsp; Now look at this outline.</p>
<p>Begin with Japheth.&nbsp; Amongst his sons we meet with three
well-known names, all connected by Ezekiel (xxxviii.) with the
north; viz., Mesech, Tubal, and Togarmah, leading us to suppose
that his descendants most probably spread along the North of
Europe and Asia; and in Genesis x. 5 it is added, &ldquo;By these
were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one
after his tongue, after their families, in their
nations&rdquo;&mdash;an expression invariably used for Europe,
and <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>all
countries approached from central Asia by sea.&nbsp; Now,
curiously enough, that very district, Europe and Northern Asia,
is regarded by the men of science as the head-quarters of those
whom they call the Aryans.</p>
<p>As for Shem, there is no difficulty in ascertaining his
head-quarters, for Abraham was his lineal descendant; and we know
that from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates was the
country given him by God.&nbsp; That country, therefore, was his
starting-point; and accordingly men of science tell us that
Western Asia, including Palestine and the adjacent countries,
must have been the home of the great Semitic family.&nbsp; Again,
therefore, there is the closest possible agreement between
ancient history and modern discovery.</p>
<p>The case of Ham is not so perfectly clear.&nbsp; According to
the book of Genesis he appears, if we understand the names, to
have spread in two directions&mdash;eastward towards Southern
Asia, and also south-west to Gaza, the gateway to Africa.&nbsp;
Though Africa is not mentioned in that passage it is clear that
the descendants of Ham spread over the isthmus of Suez into that
continent; for in Psalm cv. 23, 27, Egypt is actually called
&ldquo;the land of Ham.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now once more I turn to
the men of science, and I find that these very districts are
thought by them to be the ancient homes of those they call
Turanians.&nbsp; Now, let it be well understood, I do not say
that these outlines are never crossed, and that the races are not
found in many cases to be intermixed.&nbsp; But what I do say is,
that in their great local outlines the <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>arrangements of the men of science
correspond, in a very remarkable manner, with the arrangements
which we gather from all that we can learn from the Scripture
history.&nbsp; Once more then modern discovery bears its
testimony to Scriptural accuracy, and we welcome the men of
science as unanswerable &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; to historical
truth.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Prophecy</span>.</h3>
<p>Thus far we have not gone beyond the <i>historical</i> truth
of the Pentateuch; but now let us turn to the
<i>prophecy</i>,&mdash;that most remarkable prophecy of Noah, in
which he foreshadowed the future destiny of the great
families.&nbsp; Let us consider the three prophecies in the order
in which they stand.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Canaan.&nbsp; There is something inexpressibly
awful in the words respecting Canaan, and they are full of
instruction respecting sin.&nbsp; They show what an awful thing
sin is in the sight of God, and how superficial is man&rsquo;s
estimate of its guilt; for here is a whole race laid under a
solemn curse in consequence of the sin of its head.&nbsp; As Adam
brought a curse on the world, so Ham brought one on Canaan.&nbsp;
The curse inflicted in that case was bondage, and the prophecy
was that Canaan should be a servant of servants to both his
brethren: <i>i.e.</i> to both Shem and Japheth.&nbsp; And now
look at the fulfilment.</p>
<p>Take first a period about 1,000 years after the prophecy was
given, when the Canaanites were still in the promised land, and
Israel, the descendants of Shem, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>came up from Egypt.&nbsp; The
conflict then was between Shem and Canaan, and what was the
result?&nbsp; The greater part of the Canaanites were destroyed,
and those that remained were reduced to abject slavery.&nbsp; The
prediction was fulfilled, and Canaan became the slave of
Shem.</p>
<p>But some may say that all that was a long time ago, and only
matter of ancient history.</p>
<p>Let us then turn to our own times, and consider facts that are
within our own observation.&nbsp; How is it that our own West
Indian islands are peopled with negroes?&nbsp; Is it not because
we English made slaves of the Africans, or, in other words,
because Japheth made a slave of Canaan?&nbsp; How is it that
there is a negro population amounting to 4,000,000 in the United
States?&nbsp; Is it not for the name reason, that Japheth made a
slave of Canaan?&nbsp; How is it that up to the year 1807, when
the slave trade was abolished, the West Coast of Africa was made
the hunting-ground for all the leading nations of Europe?&nbsp;
What was it but the simple fulfilment of this prophecy, in which
it was foretold that Japheth should make a slave of Canaan?</p>
<p>And now turn to the Eastern coast of Africa, and the present
negotiations now going on in Egypt.&nbsp; One of the great
difficulties of these negotiations arises from the horrors of the
East African slave trade.&nbsp; There is an extensive trade in
slaves being carried on at this very time all along the East
Coast of Africa.&nbsp; There are gangs of miserable victims being
driven at this very hour to the principal slave markets.&nbsp;
And who are the <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>great offenders in that most nefarious and wicked
traffic?&nbsp; The Arabs, some still living in Arabia, and some
settled in Egypt at the time of the great Arab invasion of the
country.&nbsp; And who are the Arabs, and to which race do they
belong?&nbsp; I believe it is agreed by all parties that they are
Semitic, or from Shem.&nbsp; So that the result is that poor
Canaan has been enslaved by both his brethren&mdash;on the west
by Japheth, and on the east by Shem; and however deeply we
deplore the woes of Africa, and however earnestly we should arise
as one man to urge our rulers to use their powers to put down the
accursed trade, we must look on the fact of its existence with
reverent wonder, and learn from those miserable slave gangs a
most solemn lesson as to the abiding truth of the prophecies of
God.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But now let us turn to Shem, where we have a
brighter prospect; for on the mention of his name the prophet
exclaims, &ldquo;Blessed be the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
God of Shem,&rdquo; or rather, &ldquo;Blessed be Jehovah, the God
of Shem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now here we have not merely an act of
praise, but a prophecy; for there is a clear prediction that
Jehovah should be the God of Shem.&nbsp; Canaan and Japheth might
worship devils and false gods, and bow down before man-made
idols; but the God of Shem should be Jehovah Himself, and Shem
should be distinguished by the fact that Jehovah should be his
God.&nbsp; And is not this precisely what has happened?&nbsp; Up
to the time of our blessed Saviour what nation was there in the
world that worshipped <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Jehovah except the seed of
Abraham?&nbsp; It was the sacred calling of that family to stand
out alone as witnesses before an apostate world to the great
principle&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
Him only shalt thou serve.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Shem, and Shem
alone, that worshipped the one self-existent, omnipotent,
omnipresent, and everlasting Jehovah.</p>
<p>The great prophecy, therefore, was most literally fulfilled in
fact.&nbsp; But if we understand the name &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo;
as applied to the promised seed of the woman, the Saviour who was
to come, the fulfilment is still more remarkable; for it was in
the line of Shem that the Coming One appeared.&nbsp; No trouble
is taken in the Scriptures to record the genealogies of either
Ham or Japheth, and they terminate with two generations.&nbsp;
But the sacred line of Shem is carefully preserved.&nbsp; We have
every link given, from Adam to Abraham, and after that from
Abraham to the Lord Jesus; so that if we thus understand the
title Jehovah, the prophecy would mean, Blessed be the Coming
One, the Lord Jesus, the Christ, the God of Shem; and we should
see in it the prophecy that the coming deliverer, the deliverer
promised to Eve, should arise out of the family of Shem, so that
in him and his seed should all nations of the world be
blessed.&nbsp; I need not stop to point out how exactly this
prophecy was fulfilled in the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ
about 2,300 years after it was spoken by Noah.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But now for Japheth.</p>
<p>The meaning of the name is generally considered to <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>be
&ldquo;enlargement,&rdquo; and the prophecy is that he should be
enlarged.&nbsp; The meaning of this must be, that he should be
gifted with what may be termed a spreading power.&nbsp; His great
characteristic is to be expansion, or, the enlargement of his
borders.&nbsp; Now think for one moment of Europe and
Europeans.&nbsp; Think of Europe as the home of the sons of
Japheth according to the Scriptures, or of the Aryans according
to the men of science.&nbsp; And may we not appeal to any one who
will take the trouble to look around the world at this present
day, and ask whether this power of spreading is not one of the
most peculiar and exceptional features of the European
family?&nbsp; Ham and Shem are not spreading anywhere; but
Japheth everywhere.&nbsp; Why, look at this little island of our
own&mdash;one of the very least of the &ldquo;isles of the
Gentiles&rdquo;&mdash;and see how its people have spread.&nbsp;
Not only has it peopled the vast continent of America, but it
possesses at this present time such a colonial empire that the
sun never sets on the dominions of our Queen.&nbsp; Most truly
and most remarkably in our own case has God enlarged Japheth, and
so made England a &ldquo;witness to the truth&rdquo; of the
prophecy which He gave through Noah no less than 4,000 years
ago.</p>
<p>But there still remains that last clause, &ldquo;He shall
dwell in the tents of Shem,&rdquo; and, as we ought never to
speak too dogmatically respecting the prophetic Word, I am free
to admit that it is not perfectly clear in what sense it should
be understood.</p>
<p>It may refer to the spreading of the Europeans into <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>all the
nations of the world, and so dwelling in the tents of Shem; and
if there were nothing more than our own settlements in foreign
lands, there would be the most complete fulfilment of the
prophecy.</p>
<p>But surely there is more.&nbsp; And especially there is one
remarkable fulfilment, which I cannot help thinking must have
been intended in the prophecy.&nbsp; Now let us remember that the
Lord and His coming is the centre, or turning-point, of the whole
prophetic Word.&nbsp; Let us not forget how we found that the
prophecy respecting Shem appeared distinctly to foretell His
advent.&nbsp; Now when the predicted time came, and the promised
Jehovah appeared, why did He not take His place on the throne of
David, and why did He not reign in the tents of Shem?&nbsp; The
Holy Land had all been given to Abraham, and belonged to the
family of Shem; but when the Lord, the God of Shem, came, there
was neither throne nor kingdom for Him, and He had not even where
to lay His head.&nbsp; How could this be?&nbsp; And what had
become of the royal throne?&nbsp; The answer is most
remarkable.&nbsp; The Romans were on it, or, in prophetic words,
Japheth was dwelling in the tents of Shem.&nbsp; The Romans were
sons of Japheth, and by them the Lord, the God of Shem, was
supplanted on His throne.</p>
<p>But, though that was a clear, literal, and most remarkable
fulfilment of the prophecy, I cannot help thinking that in these
words the Spirit of God referred to something higher.&nbsp; When
St. James was speaking of <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the call of the Gentiles at what has
been termed the council of Jerusalem, as recorded, Acts xv. 15,
he quoted the words, &ldquo;I will build again the tabernacle of
David.&rdquo;&nbsp; The conversion of the Gentiles was compared,
therefore, to their admission into the tabernacle of David.&nbsp;
And so the safety of the believer in the Lord Jesus Christ is
compared by David himself to the shelter of God&rsquo;s
tabernacle, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in Psalm xxvii. 5, where we read,
&ldquo;In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, bearing in mind the great fact that Jehovah
is the God of Shem, and that the predicted Redeemer came from
Shem, may we not believe that the tent, or the tabernacle of
Shem, was the prophetic figure of the safety provided in the
promised Son of God?&nbsp; The word Shem means
&ldquo;name,&rdquo; and there may be something in the passage not
unlike those other words, &ldquo;The name of the Lord is a strong
tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now if the passage were so understood, it would lead to the
conclusion that Japheth would shelter himself under the Jehovah
of Shem, and so dwell, as it were, in his tent, or under his
tabernacle.&nbsp; It would lead us to expect a salvation through
the Jehovah of Shem, bestowed on Japheth in such a way that
Japheth should become possessor of Shem&rsquo;s inheritance.</p>
<p>Now if that view of the prophecy commend itself to your
judgment, remember that Noah spoke more than 4,000 years ago, and
then look at the present position of the world.&nbsp; In what
quarters of the globe do we find <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>at this present time the most general
recognition of the God of Shem?&nbsp; Which of the continents are
most prominent in the honour paid to His name?&nbsp; Certainly
neither Africa nor Asia; neither Ham nor even Shem itself.&nbsp;
Beyond all controversy the two great Christian continents that
are dwelling under Jehovah of Shem are the two peopled by
Japheth; viz., Europe and America.&nbsp; Explain it as we may,
the facts are most remarkable.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus Christ came
from Shem, and, according to the language of scientific men, was
Semitic, whereas by far the great majority of those who believe
in His Name are from Japheth, or, according to men of science,
Aryans.&nbsp; Shem has rejected its own Saviour; but Japheth has
received Him, so that, under our own eyes, and at this present
time, Japheth is dwelling in the tents of Shem.&nbsp; I know well
how grievous a perversion of truth there is throughout Europe,
and I do not for one moment maintain that the worship is pure;
but still the name of Jehovah, the God of Shem, as manifested in
the Lord Jesus Christ, is avowedly honoured, and we sons of
Japheth are at this present moment abiding in His tent.</p>
<p>Now how are we to explain all this?&nbsp; How are we to
explain the agreement between the conclusions of modern science
and the historical fact of the threefold division which occurred
more than 4,000 years ago?&nbsp; How again are we to account for
the fulfilment of the prophetic Word?&nbsp; How do we explain the
fact that, in exact accord with the prophecy, Canaan is the
servant <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of
servants; that it was from Shem that the Lord appeared; that
Japheth is at this day remarkable for enlargement; and that we
ourselves at this very moment are assembled to worship in the
house of the God of Shem?&nbsp; It is impossible to believe that
the book of Genesis was written to suit the conclusions of modern
science; for these conclusions were utterly unknown at the time
of its composition.&nbsp; It is impossible to believe that it is
the result of design in our scientific men, for such an idea
would indeed dishonour science.&nbsp; It is equally impossible to
believe that the agreement was the result of chance or accident;
for there are far too many points, both in the history and
prophecy, to render such accidental coincidence possible.&nbsp;
It is like a complicated lock which can only be opened by the key
that was made to fit it.&nbsp; No; there is only one solution of
the problem.&nbsp; As for the history, science agrees with it,
and therefore confirms its truth; and as for the prophecy, it
could have had its origin in no human calculation of the future;
for how should Noah make any calculation respecting the state of
this nineteenth century?&nbsp; But all is plain if we believe it
to be inspired.&nbsp; He who inspired the prophecy, He saw the
end from the beginning.&nbsp; He knew all, and by the lips of
Noah he foretold what he foreknew; and thus we are brought to the
conclusion, so plainly stated by St. Peter&mdash;&ldquo;The
prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of
God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>THE
JEWS.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> about, if God permit, to speak
now of, by far, the most remarkable people in the world.&nbsp; In
the last chapter we studied the Races, and found that through the
labours of scientific men the three patriarchs of 4,000 years ago
reappear in this nineteenth century as most important
&ldquo;witnesses to truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; We put, as it were, Shem,
Ham, and Japheth into the witness-box, and the result of their
testimony was that Noah was inspired, and the Bible true.&nbsp;
Such a subject as that has a tendency to lose power through the
vastness of its extent.&nbsp; Our reading is not sufficiently
wide, nor our minds sufficiently large, to enable us to take in
the whole.&nbsp; We are dependent, moreover, on scientific men;
and it is a strange thing, but a fact, that those who talk most
of science are generally the least disposed to receive the
conclusions of scientific men, when those conclusions differ from
their own.&nbsp; But now I am about to call witnesses, in the
examination of whom we do not want the help of science; for in
their case there are no scientific difficulties.&nbsp; Their
evidence is within reach of us all, and if we choose we may test
it for ourselves.&nbsp; I am not about to speak of what happened
4,000 years ago; but of what is going on now, of what <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>took place
last year, and what any one may see for himself, if he will take
the trouble to go to Houndsditch or Petticoat Lane.&nbsp; There
he will find a most remarkable people, eager, quick, and
intelligent, exceedingly different from the rest of the
inhabitants of London, and separated from their fellow-townsmen
by a social barrier, which is very seldom overstepped.&nbsp;
These remarkable people are the Jews.</p>
<p>Now there are five undoubted and indisputable facts respecting
the Jews that I propose, if God permit, to bring before you, and
may He be pleased to help our study to the confirmation of our
faith, and to the increase of our interest in His own ancient
people!</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; <i>Their Expatriation</i>, or their expulsion as a
nation from their country.</p>
<p>Now it is a curious fact, that there is no other nation in the
world which has such a right to its own country as the
Jews.&nbsp; Other nations claim their country simply through the
right of occupation.&nbsp; We live in England, and our fathers
lived there before us, so we consider it ours, and are ready to
lay down our lives for its safety.&nbsp; But we have no
title-deeds, and we have no documents to prove that it is
ours.&nbsp; But it is very different with the Jews.&nbsp; They
have the clearest possible documentary evidence of their covenant
right to Palestine.&nbsp; There is not a person in any town who
has a better title to his house than the Jews have to their
country.&nbsp; It was distinctly given to them by God Himself, as
we read in Gen. xv. 18.&nbsp; And yet after having occupied it
for fifteen <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>centuries, and after having shown the utmost courage and
determination in its defence, they were driven from their homes
by their Roman conquerors.&nbsp; Their city was sacked, their
temple burnt with fire, their country laid desolate, and they
themselves scattered homeless through the world.&nbsp; The result
is that at this present time there are many more Jews in London
than there are in the whole of Palestine.&nbsp; Now these are
plain, well-known facts, and facts so well established that they
are beyond the reach of contradiction.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; <i>Dispersion</i>.&nbsp; When their home was broken
up in Jerusalem they were not carried elsewhere as they were when
they entered it, like a hive of bees moved from one garden to
another, but they were dispersed in all directions.&nbsp; From
that day they have had no resting-place anywhere, and they have
never since had what we may term a central home.&nbsp; They have
had no head-quarters, and, although they cluster more thickly in
some places than in others, they have on the whole gone forth as
lone wanderers on the face of the earth.&nbsp; The result is
that, go where you will, you are sure to meet with Jews.&nbsp;
They are sometimes driven about by persecution, and sometimes
attracted by trade; but we need not study the cause of their
movements.&nbsp; They are found in all the
continents&mdash;Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Australia; in
new settlements and old countries, in all climates and amongst
all races; and as the seed is scattered over the field, so the
Jewish people are dispersed through the world.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>(3.)&nbsp; <i>Distinction</i>, <i>or
Distinctiveness</i>.</p>
<p>It appears to be the general law of human nature, that when
different races live together they become, before long, fused
with each other.&nbsp; There may be exceptions, as there are in
certain cases; but there is always some cause to account for
it.&nbsp; In India, for example, there is very little fusion
between the English and the Hindoo; but then it must be
remembered that no English ever settle in India as their
permanent home.&nbsp; So in America there is not much fusion
between the European races and the negroes; but there again we
must remember that there is the almost impassable barrier of the
difference of colour as well as the slave curse on Canaan.&nbsp;
But in ordinary cases there is always fusion, and when there is
no such barrier the races soon amalgamate.&nbsp; In our own
country, for example, there are Britons, Romans, Saxons, Danes,
and Normans; but who can distinguish them?&nbsp; We are all
merged into one race, and the distinction of our nationality is
totally lost.&nbsp; Who could pick out from any congregation the
Roman, the Dane, or the Norman?&nbsp; But the Jew remains
distinct.&nbsp; There is nothing to keep him separate, but
separate he remains.&nbsp; He is rich, and enterprising, and
talented, and often exceedingly handsome; but he does not
amalgamate, and he remains to this day as distinct from us all as
he was when he first landed on our shores.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; <i>Reproach and persecution</i>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the wealth and great ability of the <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Jewish
nation, they have always been a people under reproach.&nbsp; In
trade, if people wish to describe any one as covetous, grasping,
and avaricious, it is not an uncommon thing for people to say
that he is &ldquo;a regular Jew,&rdquo; and thus, whatever a
person may be in himself, the name &ldquo;Jew&rdquo; is a term of
opprobrium throughout the world.</p>
<p>But reproach is not all, nor nearly all; for they have had to
endure the most terrible persecutions.&nbsp; They have been
treated most barbarously by the nations amongst whom they have
been scattered.&nbsp; It has mattered little whether they have
been living amongst Pagans, Mahommedans, or spurious Christians,
though I fear it must be admitted that the treatment by spurious
Christians has been the worst.&nbsp; But I need not dwell on
these horrible atrocities; for they are fresh in our own
memories.&nbsp; We have only to go back to the newspapers of last
year to learn what the poor Jews endured in Southern
Russia.&nbsp; Their property was plundered, their homes burnt,
their daughters&mdash;oh, I cannot tell you the
horrors!&mdash;and their whole families cast out on a pitiless
world to perish from cold, hunger, and nakedness; and all this in
the face of the whole of Europe in this enlightened nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; <i>Preservation</i>.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all this they have been preserved.&nbsp;
Kindness has not fused them, reproach has not shamed them, and
persecution has not destroyed them; so that after eighteen
centuries they are in the midst <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of us still&mdash;still scattered
through the world, still remaining a separate people, still under
reproach and persecution, but still moving amongst us as an
active, intelligent body of men; in the midst of us, but not of
us; living in England, but not Englishmen; the subjects of
another dynasty, the proprietors of another land, and the scions
of another home.</p>
<p>Now I wish to put it to all thinking and observing men, Can
they refer me to any other people in the world in which these
five facts are found to meet?&nbsp; Do they know of any other
people that was ever so completely removed from its home, that
was ever so effectually dispersed amongst the nations, that has
been kept so distinct, that has endured such reproach and
persecution, and that, notwithstanding all, has been so long
preserved?&nbsp; There have been amongst other races conquests,
massacres, and migrations; but I venture to affirm, without the
slightest hesitation, that you may search history from one end to
the other, may ransack its pages for all that you can find
respecting the nations, and I venture to affirm, without the
slightest fear of contradiction, that you will not find one in
which any of those facts have taken place as they have with the
Jews, and still less one in whom in this most extraordinary
manner they have all been found to meet.</p>
<p>But now comes the question, How is all this to be
explained?&nbsp; What is it that has made the Jews such an
exceptional people?&nbsp; What is it that has made their
experience so entirely different to that of all the other <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>peoples upon
the earth?&nbsp; I ask the infidel to tell me if he can, but I
know he cannot; I ask the man of science to explain it on
scientific principles, but I know he cannot.&nbsp; But I ask the
believer to explain it, and he can do so in a moment by the
simple answer, &ldquo;It is the hand of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
some man may say, &ldquo;How do you know that it is the hand of
God?&nbsp; What proof have you that it is His doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;
A perfectly clear proof that it is impossible to deny.&nbsp;
There is a <i>sixth</i> fact quite as plain as the other five;
<i>i.e.</i>, that all the five facts were predicted in the
prophecies, and that centuries before the dispersion took place
it was clearly foretold in the prophecies of the Word of
God.&nbsp; These facts were all foretold in prophecy, and
therefore we are firmly persuaded that they were all brought
about by God.&nbsp; The fulfilment of prophecy is a proof that
the whole is of God.</p>
<p>In proof of this let us refer to a few passages.</p>
<p>I spoke of the fact of their <i>expatriation</i>, or expulsion
from their own land.&nbsp; Now what did Moses say of it fifteen
hundred years before it happened?&nbsp; Only mark his words:
&ldquo;Ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest
to possess it.&rdquo; (Deut. xxviii. 63.)</p>
<p>I spoke of their <i>dispersion</i> amongst the Gentiles.&nbsp;
Now what did Moses say of it?&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt be removed
into all the kingdoms of the earth.&rdquo; (<i>v.</i> 25.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the
one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt
serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,
even wood and stone.&rdquo; (<i>v.</i> 64.)</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>I spoke
of their <i>distinctness</i>.&nbsp; Now what did Balaam say of
it?&nbsp; &ldquo;The people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
reckoned amongst the nations.&rdquo; (Num. xxiii 9.)&nbsp; And
though these words were spoken no less than three thousand three
hundred years ago, do they not predict exactly that which you may
see this very day in London, Liverpool and in every other great
city of Europe?</p>
<p>I spoke of <i>reproach and persecution</i>.&nbsp; And
returning to Deut. xxviii., what do we there find?&nbsp; In verse
33 you find the prediction of persecution and spoliation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation
which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed
and crushed alway.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in verse 37 the reproach in
foretold: &ldquo;And thou shalt become an astonishment, a
proverb, and a byeword, among all nations whither the Lord shall
lead thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last fact of which I spoke was the <i>preservation</i>,
the long preservation, through those eighteen centuries of
unequalled trial; and again we turn to Moses, and find him
saying, &ldquo;And yet for all that, when they be in the land of
their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor
them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with
them: for I am the Lord their God.&rdquo; (Lev. xxvi. 44.)</p>
<p>Now all these passages are taken from the Pentateuch, the
earliest book of the Scriptures; and I have referred especially
to them because some people appear to speak with disrespect of
the Pentateuch.&nbsp; But here we see the Pentateuch prophecies
fulfilled in this nineteenth <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>century in so remarkable a manner
that no observant man can deny it.</p>
<p>But if people prefer prophecies of a later date they shall
have them; for time makes no difference to truth, and the
inspiration of the Scriptures extends through its whole
length.</p>
<p>We find that they have been driven from their country, and can
no longer inhabit the land which is their own.&nbsp; Now what did
the prophet Isaiah say?&nbsp; &ldquo;Then said I, Lord, how
long?&nbsp; And He answered, Until the cities be wasted without
inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly
desolate, and the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a
great forsaking in the midst of the land.&rdquo; (Chap. vi. 11,
12.)</p>
<p>We found that they are scattered amongst all the nations of
the world.&nbsp; Now what did God predict by the mouth of
Ezekiel?&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole remnant of thee will I scatter
into all the winds.&rdquo; (Chap. v. 10.)</p>
<p>We found that, though scattered, they are preserved as a
distinct and separate people.&nbsp; Now what did God foretell by
the prophet Amos?&nbsp; &ldquo;For, lo, I will command, and I
will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is
sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the
earth.&rdquo; (See ix. 9.)</p>
<p>We found that in their dispersion they have been the object of
cruel reproach, and have endured much fierce persecution.&nbsp;
Now what said Jeremiah, the prophet of God, in chap. xxix.
18?&nbsp; &ldquo;And I will deliver them to be removed to all the
kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and an astonishment, and an hissing,
and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we found also that, notwithstanding all, they have been
preserved in a most marvellous manner; so that at the end of
eighteen centuries they are still amongst us a separate people,
and preserved in the providence of God.&nbsp; And is it not all
explained by that wonderful prophecy of Jeremiah?&nbsp; &ldquo;If
those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the
seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for
ever.&rdquo; (Chap. xxxi. 36.)</p>
<p>Such passages might be multiplied to almost any extent, as
they abound throughout the prophecies; and I have merely selected
a text from the Pentateuch and another from the later prophets to
illustrate each of the five facts to which we all are
witnesses.&nbsp; And are they not sufficient?&nbsp; How was it, I
ask, that these great prophecies were given, some fifteen hundred
years, and some five hundred years, before the dispersion?&nbsp;
Was it accident?&nbsp; Was it calculation or guesswork?&nbsp; How
should the writers have calculated, or, how should they have
guessed?&nbsp; One thing is perfectly plain.&nbsp; They could not
have been written after the event; for ever since that time the
Jews have been dispersed over the world, and in all their
dispersions have carried with them these prophecies.&nbsp; If
they were forged afterwards, how did the forger get them into
circulation amongst all the scattered Jews throughout the world,
and that before there was a printing-press?&nbsp; They must have
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>been
written before the event; and before the dispersion what human
mind could calculate the condition of the Jews after eighteen
centuries of wandering?&nbsp; Think calmly over it.&nbsp;
Consider well the five facts; test them both by history and the
statements of modern travellers; and I cannot doubt for one
moment that the conclusion of any thinking and intelligent man
must be that the history of the Jewish people has been ordained
of God, and that the Scriptures foretelling it were inspired by
His Spirit, I cannot imagine how it is possible to avoid the
conclusion that it is His hand which has ordered all in His
sovereign providence, and His Spirit which has so clearly and so
unmistakably foretold it all in His Word.&nbsp; While, therefore,
we grieve over the Jew, and long to see, not only the nation safe
in Palestine, but the individual safe in his own Messiah, we
consider it no small gift in these sceptical days that we have
him living amongst us as one of a separate people, and so bearing
an unconscious testimony to the truth and inspiration of the
prophecies of God.</p>
<p>But I cannot stop there; for it is not the inspiration of the
Scriptures only to which the Jews bear unconscious testimony, for
they are witnesses also to the faithfulness of God.&nbsp; Here
they are after eighteen centuries of dispersion, during which
they have lived without a king, and without a prince, and without
a sacrifice; during which they have been exposed to isolation, to
temptation, to reproach, to spoliation, and to most unjust
persecution; <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>but not one grain has been lost from the seed, and here
they are, Jews still.&nbsp; Aye, and what is more wonderful than
anything, they are thus preserved in mercy, notwithstanding all
that they have done, even in the rejection of their own
Messiah.&nbsp; How could it be, and how can such preserving mercy
be explained?&nbsp; Just turn to one text out of many that may
unlock the mystery.&nbsp; It is written, in Psalm cv. 42,
&ldquo;He remembered His holy promise, and Abraham His
servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was His own covenant given to
Abraham, and our heavenly Father is faithful to it still.&nbsp;
Three thousand eight hundred years have not exhausted His
faithfulness, and even the sin of the Jew has not prevailed over
the fidelity of our God to His friend.&nbsp; Oh, what a lesson
does this teach us as to the faithfulness of our God!&nbsp; Will
He break the covenant which He has made with us in Christ
Jesus?&nbsp; Will He depart from the promise which He has
ratified in the precious blood of the chosen Messiah?&nbsp; Is
not the covenant with Christ as sure as that with Abraham?&nbsp;
And though we may be deeply conscious how unable we are to stand,
and still more deeply conscious how unworthy we are to be
preserved, may we not rest in the peaceful assurance of His
covenant grace, and apply to all His people in Christ Jesus these
wonderful words in Jeremiah xxxi. 37: &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord;
If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth
searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel
for all that they have done, saith the Lord&rdquo;?</p>
<h2><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>PALESTINE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Can</span> stones speak?&nbsp; Can rocks
make their voice to be heard?&nbsp; The Lord said of His people
on His entrance into Jerusalem, &ldquo;If these should hold their
peace the stones would immediately cry out.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this
is very much what those very stones are now doing; for the stones
of Palestine are beginning to speak with a voice so clear and
decisive that it seems a perfect marvel that any thinking man
should be able to resist their evidence.&nbsp; Now therefore, if
God permit, we will study their testimony; we will put the rocks
into the witness-box, and endeavour calmly to learn from them
what they teach us of the truth of God.&nbsp; There are three
subjects on which their evidence is conclusive&mdash;the
geographical accuracy, the historical truth, and the prophetic
inspiration of the Scriptures.&nbsp; Let us examine them on all
three points, and may that divine Spirit who inspired the word of
His own great grace bring it home to our understandings and our
hearts!</p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Geographical
Accuracy</span>.</h3>
<p>We must remember that a large portion of the Old Testament
consists in the history of that chosen line which connected the
Lord Jesus Christ with Abraham, <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and that the country which we
generally call &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo; was given to that family
as their home.&nbsp; It was in that country that Abraham
sojourned, and that his family lived for the 1,400 years between
the Exodus and the Advent.&nbsp; It is obvious therefore that the
history of that family during all those centuries must abound in
allusions to the different places in that country, and as the
history enters very much into social life, we must naturally
expect very frequent allusions to the places in which the people
lived.</p>
<p>It is important for us also to remember that the history was
not one book written by one author at one time, but that much of
it was evidently contemporary history; so that there were
different books written by different authors at different times,
beginning with Moses 3,300 years ago, and ending, as some
suppose, with Ezra, or Nehemiah, about 2,300 years ago.</p>
<p>Now the question is, &ldquo;Do the various allusions to places
which lie scattered up and down the history agree or disagree
with what we know of those places from observation on the
spot?&rdquo;&nbsp; Through the patient labours of some eminently
scientific men working for the Palestine Exploration Fund, we
know a vast deal more of the country than has ever been known
since the dispersion of the people.&nbsp; We have before us the
result of a most careful scientific survey, from which we may
learn in perfect confidence the evidence of the rocks.&nbsp; What
we have to do therefore is to lay side by side the evidence of
the rocks and the evidence of the <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Books&mdash;to compare the two
carefully, and to ascertain whether or not the
&ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; agree.&nbsp; The ancient rule was, that
&ldquo;out of the mouth of two witnesses shall every word be
established.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here then there are two
witnesses&mdash;the rocks and the Books&mdash;do they or do they
not agree?</p>
<p>Let us begin with the Book of Joshua, a book recording the
original invasion of the country, and the distribution of the
land among the tribes.&nbsp; In the ten chapters, beginning with
the 13th, we have a full account of that distribution, and a
clear definition of the boundaries of eleven tribes, with a list
of forty-eight cities assigned to the sons of Levi.&nbsp; This
list and these boundaries have been most carefully examined by
the officers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and the
remarkable result is that they can trace almost every place
mentioned in Joshua; and what is more remarkable still,
&ldquo;there is scarcely a village which does not retain for its
desolate heap or its modern hovels the Arabic equivalent for the
name written down by Joshua 3,300 years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; In many
cases there is nothing more than a cluster of a few wretched Arab
huts, or a heap of shapeless ruins; but so complete has been the
identification that there is no doubt left respecting
Joshua&rsquo;s boundaries; and if the Jews were to return
to-morrow, and in returning were to observe the distinction of
the tribes, those officers could at once point out to them their
several homes, and show them exactly what portion of the country
was originally assigned to them by lot.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>This
general fact is quite sufficient to prove the general accuracy of
the geography of the Book.&nbsp; But the general fact does not
stand alone, and there are countless details which are almost
more conclusive than the close agreement which we find existing
between the list by Joshua and that by scientific men.&nbsp; Let
us consider one of these details, and examine one neighbourhood
in the light of modern science.&nbsp; The neighbourhood shall be
that of Bethel and Hai.&nbsp; Respecting Bethel, no one, I
believe entertains a doubt.&nbsp; It was named by Jacob
&ldquo;Bethel,&rdquo; or the house of God.&nbsp; It was
afterwards called &ldquo;Bethaven,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the house of
vanity,&rdquo; in consequence of the idolatry of Jeroboam; and
the extensive ruins now found there are called Beitin.&nbsp; Now
Bethel does not stand alone, for it is frequently connected with
Hai; so that Abraham&rsquo;s second halting-place, as recorded in
Gen. xii. 8, was on a mountain &ldquo;having Bethel on the west,
and Hai on the east.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were two ranges of hills
running from north to south, with a valley between them, and on a
hill standing in that valley Abraham pitched his tent, and built
an altar unto the Lord.&nbsp; Now, as I have just said, there is
not the slightest doubt about the identification of Bethel.&nbsp;
But what are we to say of Hai?&nbsp; In Joshua viii. we have an
accurate description of its capture, and every detail of the
attack can be verified on the spot.&nbsp; But we cannot find the
name.&nbsp; There is a heap, or mound, on the slope of the hill,
which no doubt marks the site.&nbsp; But the name Hai is
completely lost.&nbsp; The <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>name given to the mound is
Tell.&nbsp; Now Tell is the word for heap, so that Tell Ashtereh
is the heap of Ashtaroth, and Tell Kedes the heap of
Kadesh.&nbsp; But to this heap there is no such name attached,
and the only name is Tell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell&rdquo; alone marks
the spot.&nbsp; And now turn to Joshua viii. 28: &ldquo;And
Joshua burnt Hai, and made it an heap&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> a Tell)
&ldquo;for ever, even a desolation unto this day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The name given by the modern Bedouin is exactly that of the
ancient record, and the testimony of the stones is in perfect
agreement with the scriptural narrative.</p>
<p>But this is not all.&nbsp; I have already pointed out that the
hill between Bethel and Hai was Abraham&rsquo;s second
halting-place; and if we turn to Gen. xiii. we shall find, in
verses 3, 4, that after he had been down into Egypt he returned
to that same spot, and there once more he called on the name of
the Lord.&nbsp; It was there that he made Lot the generous offer
of the choice of the land, and that &ldquo;Lot lifted up his eyes
and beheld all the plain of Jordan.&rdquo;&nbsp; But at first
sight this seems impossible, for between Bethel and Jordan there
is a lofty range of hills running from north to south, and
completely obstructing the view; and so the merely superficial
observer might say that the Book was wrong.&nbsp; But before we
come to any such decision we must consult the stones.&nbsp; And
what will they say to us?&nbsp; Go up the heights above Bethel on
the west, and they will tell you that there is no view of the
plain of Sodom there.&nbsp; Go up on the eastern side to the Tell
that once <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>was Hai, and there is no view there.&nbsp; But now go to
the mountain having Bethel on the west and Hai on the east, the
very spot where, according to the 13th chapter of Genesis,
Abraham and Lot were standing; and there through a gap in the
hills you see the very sight that tempted Lot, and you look on
the plains of Sodom, as Lot looked on them not much less than
4,000 years ago.</p>
<p>And what makes the agreement still more wonderful is that the
Book was written by one who was not an inhabitant of the country,
and who had never stood on that mountain-top.&nbsp; It is obvious
from the history that Moses was never there, and accordingly it
is obvious from the Book that it was written on the eastern side
of Jordan.&nbsp; In all the Books written in Palestine the
expression &ldquo;Beyond Jordan&rdquo; is employed to describe
the eastern side.&nbsp; But it is not so with the Book of
Genesis.&nbsp; In chapter l. 10 there is the mention of the
&ldquo;threshing-floor of Atad,&rdquo; where Joseph and his
company made a mourning for Jacob, and in verse 11 this place is
said to be &ldquo;beyond Jordan.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Atad was on the
west side of Jordan, for it was amongst the Canaanites, and is
believed by learned men to have been between the Jordan and
Jericho.&nbsp; To Moses, therefore, approaching Canaan from the
east, it was &ldquo;beyond Jordan.&rdquo;&nbsp; To any pretender
writing after the occupation of the promised land it would have
been &ldquo;on this side Jordan.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to Moses, who
died on the eastern side, and never set his foot on the western
side, it was &ldquo;beyond.&rdquo;&nbsp; He may have <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>seen it from
Pisgah, but that was all.&nbsp; He never set his foot there, for
he never crossed the Jordan.&nbsp; So he never set his foot on
the mount between Bethel and Ai; but he wrote with the most
minute geographical accuracy.&nbsp; And thus we have the
testimony of the stones that the Book of Genesis was not only the
Book of truth, but, may we not add, that Moses was inspired by
God Himself to write with such perfect truthfulness of places
which he had never seen?</p>
<p>This one instance must suffice as an illustration of
<i>geographical</i> accuracy, and we may hasten to consider the
second point; viz.:&mdash;</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Historical Truth</span>.</h3>
<p>To this I turn with deeper interest, because it has been
denied.&nbsp; Voltaire, for example, describes Palestine as one
of the worst countries of Asia, comparing it to Switzerland, and
says it can only be esteemed fertile &ldquo;when compared with
the desert.&rdquo; (<span class="smcap">Keith</span>, p.
106.)&nbsp; There cannot be one moment&rsquo;s doubt that in such
statements he exceeded fact.&nbsp; But others have pointed to the
desolate hillsides, and asked the question whether such a country
could ever have supported a population as dense as that of
Norfolk or Suffolk.&nbsp; Now let there be no mistake on this
subject; for we are fully prepared most freely to admit that the
hill country, as we now see it, could not possibly support a
large population, and that there is a dreary, barren desolation
about it which is wholly unlike the descriptions <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of rich
fertility which abound through the Scriptures.&nbsp; One of these
descriptions will be sufficient; viz., Deut. viii. 7&ndash;9:
&ldquo;For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a
land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out
of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and
fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a
land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt
not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of
whose hills thou mayest dig brass.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now I am not in
the least afraid of saying plainly that such a description as
that is not true of <i>modern</i> Palestine.&nbsp; It is not a
good land flowing with milk and honey; it is not a land of vines
and oil olives; it is not a land from which a large population
could eat bread without scarceness.&nbsp; I read that there is
not a vine to be seen between Eschol and Beersheba, and that
there are very few olives to be found anywhere.&nbsp; What then
are we to say?&nbsp; Was the historical description true, or was
it not?&nbsp; Were the people deceived, or was God true to His
Word?&nbsp; &ldquo;Let God be true, but every man a
liar.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this point let us ask the stones, and let
us take the testimony of the rocks.&nbsp; But in doing this we
must not be content with taking a tourist&rsquo;s ticket, and
hurrying as fast as possible along the beaten tracks; but we must
accompany our scientific men in their investigations; and if we
do so, what shall we find?&nbsp; In the first place we shall find
scattered through the country the ruins of an enormous number <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of
villages.&nbsp; The Exploration Fund have actually entered on
their map no less than 2,770 names.&nbsp; It is perfectly clear
therefore that there was once a very large and densely-packed
population.&nbsp; Then in the next place the careful observer
will perceive that those hills which are now so barren were once
covered with terraces so as to preserve the soil.&nbsp; Dr. Keith
says that on one hill he counted no less than sixty-seven such
terraces one above another.&nbsp; Then if you examine these
terraces you find a countless number of cisterns and
water-courses cut in the rocks, proving clearly that there was
once a careful system of irrigation; and then, in conclusion,
near many of the villages there is found an olive-press,
apparently used by the whole village, while up amongst the
terraces there are multitudes of smaller wine-presses, apparently
cut in the rocks by each proprietor for his own use.&nbsp; In
confirmation of this evidence I have been informed by one for
many years a resident in Jerusalem, that the inhabitants are
dependent for firewood on the roots of the vines and the olives
still found on the desolate hillsides.&nbsp; The roots remain,
though the trees are gone, and those roots unite in their
testimony with the rocks amongst which they are found.&nbsp; The
evidence therefore of the rocks is irresistible.&nbsp; The people
are scattered through the nations, and the rain has washed down
the toil from the broken terraces; but the rocks remain; and the
proof is as clear as any proof can be of anything, that there was
once a teeming population and a high state of <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>cultivation,
that the country was once a land of vines and oil olives, and
that it was a land maintaining a prosperous, thriving, and
painstaking people.&nbsp; Thus the rocks agree with the
Book.&nbsp; Those barren hills themselves supply the evidence of
their former fertility, and the stones cry out that the grand old
Pentateuch is historically true.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Prophetic
Inspiration</span>.</h3>
<p>But we have not yet done with those barren hills; for we have
not yet exhausted their evidence.&nbsp; Some may enquire how it
is that a country which was once so fertile is now become so
desolate; and the answer may be given that the villages have been
burned, the terraces neglected, the cisterns broken, and the
water-courses choked, which is all perfectly true.&nbsp; But that
is not enough to satisfy a real enquirer.&nbsp; &ldquo;How was
it,&rdquo; the thoughtful man will ask, &ldquo;that the villages
were burned and the terraces neglected?&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
answer of this question the rocks can give us no assistance, and
we must depend entirely on the Book; but there we find the whole
mystery solved.&nbsp; The fact is, that the whole country bears
witness to the truth of prophecy.&nbsp; The present state of
things is exactly what God foretold in His Word.&nbsp; It is
perfectly true that the mountains are dreary, barren, and
desolate; perfectly true that it is no longer &ldquo;the land
flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands;&rdquo; but
it is equally <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>true that the change which has taken place is exactly
that which God foretold in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>What did Moses write three thousand three hundred years
ago?&nbsp; Turn to Leviticus xxvi. 33: &ldquo;And I will scatter
you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you; and
your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did Isaiah say, writing about two thousand five hundred
years ago?&nbsp; Turn to Isaiah vi. 11: &ldquo;Then said I, Lord,
how long?&nbsp; And He answered, Until the cities be wasted
without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be
utterly desolate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Turn to chap. xxiv. 3: &ldquo;The
land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for the Lord
hath spoken this word.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or to chap. xxxii. 12, 13:
&ldquo;They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields,
for the fruitful vine.&nbsp; Upon the land of my people shall
come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the
joyous city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did Jeremiah say, writing about two thousand three
hundred years ago?&nbsp; Turn to Jeremiah iv. 26, 27: &ldquo;I
beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the
cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and
by His fierce anger.&nbsp; For thus hath the Lord said, The whole
land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The spoilers are come upon all high
places through the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord shall
devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the
land: no flesh shall have peace.&rdquo; (Chap. xii. 12.)</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>And
what did Ezekiel, writing about the same time, predict of the
condition of Palestine during the dispersion, and until the
restoration of the people?&nbsp; Turn to his address to those
hills of which we have been speaking, in Ezekiel xxxvi. 3, 4:
&ldquo;Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God;
Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on
every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the
heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an
infamy of the people: therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the
word of the Lord God; Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains,
and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the
desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which
became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are
round about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here then we have the whole mystery solved, and the whole
thing explained.&nbsp; In His sure Word of prophecy our heavenly
Father told us what He would do, and the desolate hills of
Palestine bear witness that He has done it.&nbsp; We may long to
see them clothed once more with the vine and the olive, and we
may profoundly pity their lawful proprietors, who look on their
lawful home&mdash;once so beautiful, but now so desolate!&nbsp;
But yet we cannot look even on that desolation without
thanksgiving, for it is an evidence to all thinking men of the
certain truth of God&rsquo;s inspired Word.&nbsp; Those who refer
to those desolate hills as an argument against the truth forget
that the desolation to which they refer is <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>a conclusive
proof of the truth of the <i>prophetic</i> Word of God.&nbsp;
Thus we are carried by this third proof far beyond either
geographical accuracy or historical truth.&nbsp; A book may be
geographically accurate, or historically true, and yet not be
inspired.&nbsp; But no <i>man</i> can foretell the future.&nbsp;
No man can look forward 3,000 years.&nbsp; No man, therefore,
could span over all those centuries and tell us ages ago what
would be the condition of Palestine in this nineteenth
century.&nbsp; But God has done it.&nbsp; We thank God,
therefore, for His Word, and we thank Him also for the testimony
of the rocks.&nbsp; Nay, more, we may thank Him even for the
sneers of such a man as Voltaire, for the very sneers are a proof
to the students of the Scriptures that God&rsquo;s prophecy is
being fulfilled, and that God&rsquo;s Holy Word may be trusted as
divine.</p>
<p>But we must not leave the subject there, for we are taught a
most solemn lesson as to the desolating power of a righteous
God.&nbsp; He who has reduced those fertile hills to desolation,
cannot He equally desolate the soul, and reduce the poor ruined
heart to a similar condition of barren hopelessness?&nbsp; And
will He not do it if His great salvation be neglected?&nbsp; I
know that it is the fashion to believe that He is too merciful to
punish; but for my own part I find it much more easy to believe
that he is too true to declare that which he has no intention of
performing.&nbsp; If the Word of God be true, &ldquo;Verily there
is a God that judgeth the earth,&rdquo; and we cannot doubt that
to the guilty sinner He must prove <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>&ldquo;a consuming fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But, thanks be to His Holy Name, if the warnings be true, so also
are the promises.&nbsp; If the judgment be certain, so also is
the salvation.&nbsp; If the minister of wrath be sure to fulfil
the Word of judgment, so also is the blessed Saviour perfectly
sure to fulfil the promises of life.&nbsp; If the law condemn
with infallible certainty, so also does the Gospel proclaim that
the claim of the law is satisfied in the great propitiation by
the Son of God; so that any one, even the least and most unworthy
of His people, may peacefully rest in the certainty of His
never-failing Word, and abide in perfect peace, and perfect
safety, in the perfect truth, and never-failing covenant of
God.</p>
<h2><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>SCOFFERS.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">propose</span> to call the evidence of
an <i>unwilling</i> witness, and to ask the scoffer himself to
bear his &ldquo;testimony to the truth&rdquo; against which he
scoffs.&nbsp; There is no better evidence than that which is
given unwillingly&mdash;than that of a man who is put into the
witness-box in order to prove one thing, and when closely
examined is compelled by the force of truth to prove the
opposite.&nbsp; Now as a general rule the scoffers desire to
dishonour the Scriptures; they ridicule its statements, and deny
its inspiration.&nbsp; But I am not sure that, if carefully
examined, they will not be found to confirm the Word.&nbsp; Let
us then carefully study their evidence, and may God the Holy
Ghost bring it home to their hearts and our own!</p>
<p>But before we examine the modern scoffers, we must turn to
what the Word of God has said respecting them.&nbsp; Rather more
than eighteen hundred years ago the apostle Peter wrote two
letters, the first addressed to scattered strangers, and the
second to those who had &ldquo;obtained like precious faith with
us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this second Epistle he gave a divine
prophecy to all such persons, and told them from God what they
were to <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>expect in the latter days.&nbsp; He taught them quite
clearly that when they were approaching the end they were not to
expect to be like some beautiful ship (with its sails set and its
flags flying) sailing gallantly into the harbour, with a bright
sunshine, a flowing tide, and a prosperous breeze; but rather
like some weather-beaten craft, battered by the storm, beating up
against the gale, and almost overwhelmed by the breakers on the
bar.&nbsp; And it teaches also that one of the trials of those
last days will arise from scoffers.&nbsp; As in navigation the
chart may teach that there are dangerous rocks near the harbour
mouth, so the prophecy says that when we draw near to the coming
of the Lord, there will arise certain persons who will not be
afraid even to scoff at the revelation of God.&nbsp; Let us first
examine the prophecy, and then we shall be prepared to compare it
with the fact.&nbsp; It assures us then of the fact that there
will be scoffers, and it gives us a fourfold description of their
character.</p>
<p>We shall find it in 2 Peter iii. 3&ndash;5: &ldquo;Knowing
this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers,
walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise
of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things
continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.&nbsp;
For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God
the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water
and in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; <i>They will scoff</i>.</p>
<p>Now, as a general rule, a scoffer is not a reasoner.&nbsp; It
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>requires
some knowledge and logical power to argue, but any fool can
scoff.&nbsp; In fact, it seems the peculiar attribute of folly;
for we are distinctly told that &ldquo;fools make a mock of
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now in this passage it is clearly foretold that
in the last days men will scoff.&nbsp; But when St. Peter wrote
the words he must have thought it almost impossible.&nbsp; For
let any man look around at the visible effects of sin&mdash;the
ruin, the misery, the wretched homes, the miserable wives, the
pitiable children, the sickness, poverty, crime, violence, and
every species of abomination resulting from sin&mdash;and can any
wise man scoff at sin?</p>
<p>Or look at the majesty of God, at His omnipotence, His
omnipresence, His omniscience, His infinitude, His holiness, His
sin-abhorring character, and it seems impossible that there
should be anyone bold enough to presume to scoff at the Most High
God.</p>
<p>Or look at His love in Christ Jesus; in the provision of such
a salvation for sinners such as we are; in providing such a Lamb
for the burnt-offering; in making to the guilty such an offer of
such a salvation on such terms of magnificent generosity, and can
it be possible that any man should scoff at that?&nbsp; Will they
scoff at the love that prompted it, at the sacrifice made for it,
or at the pardon and life presented through it?&nbsp; We might as
well expect to see the condemned criminal scoffing at a free
pardon from the Queen.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding all that, the prophecy says plainly that
in the last days there shall be scoffers.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>(2.)&nbsp; The next clause throws further light on their
character; for it teaches that <i>they will walk after their own
lusts</i>.&nbsp; Now &ldquo;lust&rdquo; does not mean merely the
low, vicious, depraved passion of the profligate; but the word in
old English expresses exactly the meaning of the Greek&mdash;the
appetite or will of the natural man.&nbsp; A person, therefore,
may be what &ldquo;the world&rdquo; calls a moral man, and still
be walking after his own lust.&nbsp; Such characters are
described by the prophet Isaiah in the words, &ldquo;We have
turned every one to his own way.&rdquo; (Chap. liii. 6.)&nbsp;
And again, chap. lxvi. 3, &ldquo;Yea, they have chosen their own
ways.&rdquo;&nbsp; They make of themselves their own god.&nbsp;
They set up their own understanding as their teacher, and their
own will as their law.&nbsp; Their religion consists in one
letter of the alphabet, that one most absorbing letter,
&ldquo;I.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; &ldquo;I
think&rdquo; &ldquo;I choose,&rdquo; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I act as I think proper;&rdquo;
and thus it is that their own will becomes their only god.&nbsp;
Oh what a miserable god!&nbsp; Oh, what a contrast to the life of
him who knows his Saviour! to the blessedness of the man whose
life is hid with Christ in God, and whose daily prayer is,
&ldquo;Thy will be done!&rdquo;&nbsp; But though it seem almost
impossible, the words of the prophecy are perfectly clear that
the rise of such characters will be amongst the anxious trials of
the latter days.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But this is not all; for the next clause shows
<i>they will scoff at the hope of the Advent</i>, and they will
say, &ldquo;Where is the promise of His coming? for since the
fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the beginning
of the creation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This does not mean, &ldquo;Where
shall we find the promise in the Scriptures?&rdquo; but rather,
&ldquo;What has become of it?&nbsp; Everything is going on just
as it always has done, and He is not come yet.&nbsp; The winter
comes and goes, the sun rises and sets, the business of life goes
on as in former days, and the Lord has not yet appeared; so what
are we to think of the promise?&rdquo;&nbsp; St. Peter points out
the true answer to all this; viz., that God&rsquo;s time must not
be measured by man&rsquo;s scale; for that &ldquo;one day is with
the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
day,&rdquo; and he might have added that prophecy of our Lord
Himself, in which he taught us that everything will go on exactly
the same right up to His return; viz., &ldquo;For as in the days
that were before the flood they were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all
away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.&rdquo;
(Matt. xxiv. 38, 39.)&nbsp; It is most important that we bear
this well in mind; for there is an undoubted tendency in us all
to settle down into an undefined feeling that things that have
gone on without a change will go on still without a change, and
so to allow our hope of the Advent to grow weary, or to burn
itself out through delay.&nbsp; There is this tendency in even
the Christian mind, and in all probability there are few amongst
us who have not felt the need of watching against the
temptation.&nbsp; So in this prophecy the scoffer is predicted as
availing himself of this natural <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>tendency in our hearts, and turning
it against the promises of God; as attacking the Christian in His
blessed hope; as striving to shake the faith of believers; and as
endeavouring to pull down those who are looking for the Lord to
the dreary level of utter hopelessness on which he finds that he
himself is standing.&nbsp; It seems a very cruel thing, and I
often think that if I were an infidel I could not endeavour to
shake the faith of other men.&nbsp; It seems a horrible thing,
that because a man is without hope himself, he should endeavour
to take away hope from others; and a most especially horrible
thing that he should endeavour to poison the minds of children,
and so harden their young hearts against the reception of the
truth of God.&nbsp; But though it seem so cruel, so unnatural,
and so contrary to any principle of ordinary benevolence, the
prophecy teaches quite plainly that so it will be in the
&ldquo;latter days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; But there is one more feature in the description;
viz., this, that <i>these scoffers are</i> &ldquo;<i>willingly
ignorant</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ignorance here predicted has
special reference to the creation and the flood; but the point to
which I would draw your most especial attention is the
<i>willingness</i> of its character.&nbsp; Ignorance in many
cases is the result of circumstances, and in some of grave
misfortune.&nbsp; There are some who long for knowledge, but have
no opportunity of obtaining it; and there are many others who,
though they show no such thirst, cannot be blamed; for they have
never known enough even to excite an <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>appetite.&nbsp; But the prophecy
describes men who are determinately and wilfully ignorant; who
are ignorant, not because they <i>cannot</i> know, but because
they <i>will</i> not.&nbsp; They are like those persons described
in Romans i. 28: &ldquo;Even as they did not like to retain God
in their knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such are the people described in
this prophecy&mdash;persons who are profoundly ignorant of the
whole purpose of God in Christ Jesus; who know absolutely nothing
of that knowledge of the true God and of &ldquo;Jesus Christ,
whom He has sent,&rdquo; which the Lord Himself declared to be
&ldquo;life eternal;&rdquo; and who do not wish to know it, but
had rather remain without the knowledge.&nbsp; The result is,
that they will read no Christian evidence, will care for no books
but those of infidels, and will never search their Bible, unless
it be to find out something which they may make the subject of
their mockery.&nbsp; Such is the willing ignorance most clearly
predicted in this prophecy.</p>
<p>There are, therefore, four points clearly predicted in the
character of those persons who, according to prophecy, must be
expected in the &ldquo;latter days.&rdquo;&nbsp; They will scoff;
they will walk after their own will; they will call in question
the Lord&rsquo;s coming; and they will be willingly ignorant of
His inspired truth.&nbsp; What then should be the effect on our
own minds when we see the fulfilment of this prophecy?&nbsp;
Should it shake our faith, or strengthen it?&nbsp; Should it lead
us to doubt our Bibles, or to rest in them as the truth of
God?&nbsp; When we found that Noah&rsquo;s great prophecy
respecting Shem, Ham, and Japheth was <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>fulfilled, what was the effect?&nbsp;
It assured us that the Pentateuch was true, and the Bible
inspired.&nbsp; When we found a whole series of prophecies
respecting the Jews and Palestine were literally fulfilled, what
again was the effect?&nbsp; It assured us that the Bible was
true, and those prophets inspired.&nbsp; So now, if we see with
our own eyes the clear fulfilment of St. Peter&rsquo;s prophecy,
what again must be our conclusion?&nbsp; What but that the Bible
is true, and that the apostle Peter was inspired?&nbsp; Thus it
is that the scoffer against the truth becomes a witness for the
truth, and the man who would insult our God by what he calls
&ldquo;profane jokes&rdquo; is unconsciously and unintentionally
bearing testimony to the God whom he insults.&nbsp; If there were
no such scoffers in these latter days, then indeed we might begin
to doubt the inspiration of the prophetic Word.&nbsp; If the Jews
had remained settled in their own country, and had never been
dispersed among the nations, then we might have doubted the
inspiration of the prophets respecting them; and so, if there
were no infidels and no scoffers, then we might call in question
the inspiration of the Scriptures that predicted them.&nbsp; But
now, as the Jews are witnesses to one class of prophecy, so are
the scoffers to another; and while we grieve for the poor men,
and most heartily desire to see them saved with the great
salvation, we may be at the same time thankful for their
evidence, and may accept their scoffing is an unanswerable
testimony to the prophetic truth of the inspired Scripture.</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>But
that is not all.&nbsp; For when we have such a prophecy, so full
in its prediction, and so clearly proved by its fulfilment to
have been inspired by God, we are bound by every principle of
allegiance to Him to listen to His counsel and act on His
warning.&nbsp; If we believe His Word, the least we can do is to
be on our guard; and if God has predicted scoffers, we ought to
be prepared to meet them.&nbsp; This is the application which the
apostle Peter makes of his own prophecy, and the passage is a
remarkable instance of the application of a prophecy by the
prophet who was employed to give it.&nbsp; Turn, then, to verse
17 of the chapter, and there you find him saying, &ldquo;Ye
therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i>, that you are fully warned beforehand),
&ldquo;beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.&rdquo;&nbsp; He points
to a danger against which we should watch, and a standard at
which we are to aim.&nbsp; The danger is that, &ldquo;being led
away with the error of the wicked,&rdquo; we should &ldquo;fall
from our own stedfastness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The standard is, that we
&ldquo;grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if we are to act on this advice,
it is clear that we must be armed in <i>the
understanding</i>.&nbsp; It is not enough that we feel emotion;
but we want to be able to give a reason for the hope that is in
us&mdash;to know what that hope is, and to know also the strong
foundation on which it rests.&nbsp; Most especially would I urge
this on our young men.&nbsp; As you go through life you are
almost <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>certain to meet with scoffers, and when you do you do
not want to be like them, willingly ignorant.&nbsp; Our position
is perfectly impregnable!&nbsp; We have a rock under our feet
which nothing can shake.&nbsp; We have facts which cannot be
disproved, and an accumulation of evidence which is not to be
found respecting any other book in the world.&nbsp; But we must
not let our weapons remain locked up like old armour in some
baronial hall, but we must have them out, and use them with
vigour.&nbsp; They are made of the best of steel; but we must
take care that there is no rust on the blade, and so be able to
meet the scoffer; not by scoffing, but by the sword of the
Spirit, remembering well the assurance of Scripture, that
&ldquo;the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
through God to the pulling down of strongholds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is not in the understanding only that we require to be
armed, for I believe there is no armour like <i>the heart&rsquo;s
experience of the love of God in Christ Jesus</i>.&nbsp; The
happy, consistent, thankful believer, he is not afraid of the
scoffer.&nbsp; He knows whom he has believed, and he is persuaded
that he is able to keep that which he has committed to Him
against that day.&nbsp; He pities the scoffer, therefore; but he
is not afraid of him except for the harm that he may do to
others.&nbsp; He has felt the strength of the rock under his
feet, and he is not going to be driven from it on to the shifting
sands of unsettled infidelity.&nbsp; Oh, may God grant to every
one of us strong assurance in the grace wherein we <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>stand!&nbsp;
May He keep us in the hearty enjoyment of an abiding union with
Christ Jesus our Lord! that so, strong in the Lord, and in the
power of His might, we may stand fast in Him; redeemed by His
blood; born again by His Spirit; called by the Holy Ghost;
justified in His righteousness; forgiven through His atonement;
and made heirs according to the hope of eternal life!&nbsp; If
that be granted, we can afford to be scoffed at; and if that be
ours, we should be stirred in the very depths of our soul to
fresh energy as the witnesses for Christ.&nbsp; The scoffer
himself is a witness to Him, inasmuch as he is a living,
speaking, visible proof of the fulfilment of the prophetic
Word.&nbsp; But it is not so that we must bear our
testimony.&nbsp; He is a witness to truth by his denial, we by
our confession; he by his insult, we by our reverend faith; he by
denying the coming of our Lord, we by expecting it; he by the
assertion of his own will, we by the surrender of ourselves to
the will of the Lord.&nbsp; So it is that we may realize the full
meaning of the words of our Lord, &ldquo;Ye shall receive power
after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be
witnesses unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>THE
SACRAMENTS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was one of the principles of the
ancient Jewish law, that &ldquo;in the mouth of two or three
witnesses shall every word be established.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have
already exceeded that requirement in having brought before you no
less than five &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; to establish the truth and
inspiration of the Scriptures; but I propose, if God permit, to
conclude my series with two more:</p>
<p>They shall be very simple witnesses, and to the eye of man
quite insignificant.&nbsp; They shall not have in themselves any
apparent power of testimony; but yet I believe they are intended
to speak in words of irresistible argument to all thinking men,
and I trust will carry home to the hearts of those who are not
&ldquo;willingly ignorant&rdquo; the most conclusive evidence of
the truth of God.&nbsp; I refer to the two Sacraments of the
Lord&rsquo;s appointment&mdash;Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&nbsp; In 1 John v. there appears to be a distinct
reference to the Jewish rule, and there are three witnesses
mentioned as bearing testimony upon earth&mdash;&ldquo;the
Spirit, and the water, and the blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; The passage is
not an easy one, and it behoves us to speak with caution.&nbsp;
But I cannot help believing that by &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; is
meant the testimony of the Holy Ghost in His inspired Word; and
by <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;the water and the blood,&rdquo; the two
Sacraments, Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; It is to
the testimony of these two latter witnesses that I now propose to
refer; but we must remember there is nothing in either of them of
a conspicuous or ostentatious character.&nbsp; In neither one nor
the other is there anything like a material monument, nor
anything to attract the attention of &ldquo;the world;&rdquo;
there is no erection of granite or marble, nor any inscription
like those on the stones from Nineveh; but they are both simple
acts of the simplest possible character.&nbsp; A little water is
all that is visible in the one, and a little bread and wine in
the other; and yet, though so simple, so insignificant, and so
absolutely without any visible monument, for the last eighteen
hundred years they have been bearing their testimony as
&ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; for Christ.&nbsp; Let us then conclude
our series by the examination of their evidence, and let us
consider two points: (1) Their present position; and (2) When and
how did they acquire it?&nbsp; May God so bless our study by the
Holy Ghost as to bring home conviction to all our hearts and
understandings.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; <i>Their present position</i>.</p>
<p>In order to realise this we must not confine our thoughts to
our own personal enjoyment of our own sacred privileges.&nbsp; We
may come to the Lord&rsquo;s table as individuals, and find in
the sacred feast such &ldquo;a strengthening and refreshing of
our souls&rdquo; as may be to us the most conclusive and
satisfactory evidence of <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the certain reality of the grace of
God; but our personal experience would be no evidence to others,
and our own enjoyment would not be regarded by the sceptic as a
proof; it would be evidence to ourselves, but not to him, nor to
the world at large.&nbsp; We must therefore take a wider range,
and consider only such evidence as lies within the cognizance of
all observing men.&nbsp; For this reason I have selected their
position in the Church of Christ at this present time.&nbsp; I am
not about to ask you to consider past history, but present facts;
facts that may be tested by every one, facts belonging to this
enlightened nineteenth century; and what I ask you to do is
quietly and patiently to investigate facts.</p>
<p>Taking then our standpoint in this year of our Lord, 1883, we
find that the Church of Christ has been extending for just 1850
years, and that throughout that time it has been spread by
countless agents, and in countless manners, in every direction
throughout the world.&nbsp; Starting as it did from Palestine, it
has now taken root on every continent, and it has borne the
sacred Name of our blessed Saviour into every quarter of the
globe.</p>
<p>But while there has been this world-wide spread of
Christianity, and while there is at this present time this
widely-extended acknowledgment of the Name of the Lord Jesus, it
is at the same time perfectly obvious that there are within the
Church of the baptized immense diversities both of creed and
practice.&nbsp; There are different Churches standing aloof from
each other.&nbsp; There is the <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Church of Rome in conflict with what
is called the Greek Church on the one hand, and with us
Protestants on the other.&nbsp; What is commonly called the Greek
Church consists again of many branches, or is rather an aggregate
of many independent Churches not united under any one head.&nbsp;
There is the original Greek Church, the Russian, the Syrian, the
Coptic, and the Abyssinian.&nbsp; So in the Church of Rome there
are various orders, besides the great division between the
secular and regular clergy; while we all know, to our heartfelt
sorrow, how those who are united in their love for the great
Scriptural principles of Protestant truth are still divided into
various denominations.&nbsp; Thus, looking at the Church of
Christ as a whole, we find it spread into so many places that it
encircles the world; and broken up into so many sections that it
is hard to trace what we may term any visible corporate
union.&nbsp; There is separation as to place, and divergence as
to Church organisation.</p>
<p>But now we come to the wonderful and indisputable fact that,
notwithstanding all this separation and all this divergence in
all countries and many systems, wherever we find the name of
Christ there we find His own two Sacraments; and wherever we meet
with Christianity there we are sure to meet with Baptism and the
Holy Communion, God&rsquo;s two witnesses to His inspired
truth.</p>
<p>This is sufficiently wonderful if you think merely of the
geographical extension of the Church.&nbsp; The visible <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Church is
spread amongst different nations, in different climates, and with
different habits; some of which are leading the way in
civilization and science, while some are sunk in barbarism; some
leading the thoughts of the world, and some apparently never
thinking at all; some absorbed in trade, and some so completely
without trade that they have not even a currency.&nbsp; In some
there are old churches that have existed for centuries, and in
some churches of modern formation recently called into being
through colonization and missions; and yet, though the two
Sacraments are so perfectly simple that there is nothing in
themselves to spread or perpetuate themselves, wherever you go
you find them.&nbsp; Place and space have made no
difference.&nbsp; Go to Europe, Asia, Africa, or America, it
makes no difference; wherever you go there you find God&rsquo;s
two Sacraments essentially bound up with the Christianity of the
people.</p>
<p>But what is more wonderful still, the divergences in the faith
have not destroyed them.&nbsp; There are different Churches most
earnestly opposed to each other, as the Church of England to that
of Rome, and the Church of Rome to that of Constantinople; but
all have the two Sacraments.&nbsp; So at home there are various
denominations, sadly disunited, and in some cases, I fear I must
say, opposed; but yet amidst them all there remains this
remarkable fact, that, with one or two perfectly insignificant
exceptions, they all observe these same two Sacraments.&nbsp; And
what makes this more remarkable <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>still is the fact that throughout
Christendom there are immense diversities of opinion on the
particular subject of these Sacraments; and there is scarcely any
subject around which controversy has raged more fiercely.&nbsp;
Both Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper have been the subject of
sharp contention; and they have both been misinterpreted,
misrepresented, and misused.&nbsp; Desperate heresies have been
attached to them both, and they have become the battle-field for
most determined theological conflict; but, notwithstanding all
this confusion of tongues, the great fact still remains, that
after eighteen centuries of conflict, here they are still.&nbsp;
Controversy has not destroyed them; perversion has not put an end
to them; separation has not divided them; but in the midst of all
disturbing forces they remain.&nbsp; Wherever you find
Christianity, there you find them.&nbsp; In all parts of the
world, and in all Churches on the face of the earth, they are
inseparably connected with the confession of Christ; and, as a
matter of fact, there is not a Church in Christendom which in
some mode or other does not observe them both.</p>
<p>Now in the study of this fact we must remember, as I said at
the outset, that they are not like solid marbles set up by some
great men, and so remaining as national monuments; but they
consist in very insignificant actions, and their existence
depends on their being observed by millions of insignificant
individuals.&nbsp; They are preserved, not by state authority or
church councils, but by the loving hearts of millions of
scattered individuals, who, <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>though it may be in much confusion,
desire to act on the bidding of their Lord.&nbsp; Thus they
become exceedingly like the rainbow spanning the heaven.&nbsp;
That beautiful bow, the token of the covenant, is formed by the
reflection of the sun from unnumbered millions of minute drops of
falling rain.&nbsp; Each drop is in itself a mere speck, a
nothing, falling rapidly, but shining as it falls; and all these
millions of falling drops combine to form the one beautiful arch,
which remains perfectly still, and bridges the interval between
earth and heaven.&nbsp; So these two Sacraments are maintained
throughout the world by the faith and piety of millions of
insignificant and short-lived individuals, each one undesignedly
fulfilling his own little part; while the grand combination of
all these millions of little individualities maintains in all
places and in all ages the twofold token of the everlasting
covenant of God.</p>
<p>(II.)&nbsp; Thus far I have spoken simply of facts, of facts
open to the observation of all men, and, as far as I know, denied
by none.&nbsp; I cannot imagine that even an infidel would deny
any of them.&nbsp; I may proceed then to my next question:
<i>When and how did these two Sacraments acquire this
position</i>?&nbsp; As a matter of fact they are observed
throughout Christendom; when then were they introduced, and how
did this observance begin?&nbsp; To this question our answer is
simple; for we believe that they were ordained by Christ Himself,
the one as His last act before His crucifixion, and the other
before His ascension.&nbsp; To us therefore who receive the <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Scriptures
the whole thing is perfectly clear, and the fact is explained by
the principle that all who receive the Lord Jesus Christ must
receive, in obedience to His will, the two Sacraments which He
Himself ordained.</p>
<p>But suppose there were any one who did not receive the
Scripture account, it would be extremely interesting if such an
one would endeavour to explain the introduction of either
Sacrament, and would tell us who introduced it, and when, and
how.&nbsp; If any person were now to endeavour to invent a third
Sacrament he would find it very difficult to obtain for it a
general acceptance through the world.&nbsp; The Church of Rome
endeavoured to establish a new dogma respecting the Pope&rsquo;s
infallibility, and what was the result?&nbsp; They split off a
large body of their own people, and they totally failed to
introduce their dogma amongst any of the other churches of
Christendom.&nbsp; In this respect the divisions of Christendom
tend greatly to confirm the evidence of the Sacraments; for they
show the complete impossibility of the introduction of these
Sacraments at a later date than that claimed for them in the
Scriptures.&nbsp; If Protestants had invented them, Roman
Catholics would never have received them; or, to go back to a
later date, if they had been invented by Rome they would never
have been received at Constantinople.&nbsp; The Church of God is
like a multitude of channels, all radiating from one
centre.&nbsp; If you pour water into one channel you produce no
effect on all the others, for the water will not pass across from
channel to channel; <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>but if there be a spring in the centre itself, then they
are all filled together, for they all draw from one
fountain-head.&nbsp; Just so it is with the Sacraments.&nbsp; If
they had sprung up in any one branch of the scattered Church,
they might have remained there; but there is no power on earth
that could have carried them across into the other
branches.&nbsp; So that now, as they are found in every branch,
and in every part of every branch, the only possible explanation
is that they have come direct from the fountain-head; that
therefore the Scriptural narrative is perfectly true; and that
they were founded, as there recorded, by our Lord Himself, and
none other.&nbsp; As they came from Christ, the original centre,
they spread through Christendom; as they were founded by the
Author of Christianity, they are observed wherever Christianity
exists.&nbsp; If any one doubt this conclusion, let him tell us
where, when, and by whom they were first invented, and how after
that they were spread through the world.</p>
<p>But we have not done yet; for if we believe that the two
Sacraments were founded by our Lord Himself at the time and in
the manner recorded in the Scriptures, there are certain very
important results which follow.</p>
<p>Let us confine our thoughts to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp;
It was clearly declared at the time of its institution to be a
memorial of the death and passion of our blessed Lord and
Saviour.&nbsp; It was founded, moreover, on the night before His
suffering, and that amongst men who were eye-witnesses of all
that passed.&nbsp; Such is the statement <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>of the
Scriptures, which we now follow up by the fact that, from that
day to this, wherever the name of Christ is named, there has
never been a break in the observance of that memorial.&nbsp; Now
what is the plain, simple, and obvious conclusion from all
this?&nbsp; Is it not surely this, that the facts actually took
place?&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s Supper is a memorial of the
crucifixion, and it was founded among persons who were
eye-witnesses of the whole transaction.&nbsp; Now if these facts
had never occurred, and if the Book recording them had not been a
true Book, how could the memorial have ever got its hold on the
Church?&nbsp; The truth of the Book is proved by the existence of
the memorial.&nbsp; The Book and the memorial are bound the one
to the other.&nbsp; They stand and fall together; they cannot be
separated.&nbsp; But the memorial may be seen throughout
Christendom as a visible fact.&nbsp; It is, and always has been,
co-extensive with Christianity.&nbsp; It is at this present time
open to the observation of any one; so, seeing the memorial, we
believe the Book, and are fully, perfectly, and historically
satisfied as to all the great facts of the crucifixion.</p>
<p>But we must not stop there; for the memorial is not merely a
proof of the facts of the crucifixion, but is also a proof of the
doctrine of the cross.&nbsp; We have found that the memorial
could not possibly have been introduced at any subsequent date,
but that its institution must be traced up to the fountain-head,
even to the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and those words of His, <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>&ldquo;Do
this in remembrance of me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this is not the whole
of the passage, and we must not forget those other words,
&ldquo;This is my body, which is given for you,&rdquo; and,
&ldquo;This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed
for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The memorial, therefore, is not merely a
memorial of the death, but of the purpose of it, and of the great
principle which underlies the whole.&nbsp; It is a monument of
those two sentences, &ldquo;given for you&rdquo; and &ldquo;shed
for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; If it were a granite column instead of a
simple service, these would be the two sentences to be engraved
upon it; or if men wished to make the inscription shorter still,
they might be content with two words, and write &ldquo;For
you;&rdquo; for these two words contain the pith and marrow of
the whole matter.&nbsp; It is not, therefore, merely the fact
that He died of which the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is a
divinely-appointed witness, but the fact that He died as a
vicarious satisfaction for sin&mdash;&ldquo;a propitiation for
our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the
whole world.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is well for us, therefore, to look
carefully at the certain and undeniable fact, that in this
nineteenth century the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is observed in some
form or other wherever the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is
known; to consider well the utter impossibility of its being
introduced at any period subsequent to the foundation of the
Gospel, or by any person except by Him who said, &ldquo;This do
in remembrance of me;&rdquo; and so to accept the assurance of
its testimony that the body there given was given <i>for us</i>,
and the blood there shed was <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>shed <i>for us</i>.&nbsp; Divine
atonement then is the great truth visibly signed and sealed to us
by God&rsquo;s divine memorial; and when we kneel together before
that table of His, we may accept for our own soul&rsquo;s
everlasting peace, not merely the fact that He died, but the
truth that He died as a propitiation for our sins; that His body
was given in our behalf, or <i>for us</i>, and His blood shed in
our behalf, or <i>for us</i>; and that therefore, without any
further propitiatory sacrifice, or any supplementary mode of
reconciliation, believing in Him, we are perfectly, immediately,
and eternally free.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
